# Client configuration

All live-client settings are validated by `pydantic-settings` in `src/lenia_client/settings.py`. Edit `.env` in the project working directory; `.env.example` lists every supported setting. On a fresh checkout, copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Environment variables override the file, including in Docker. Run `make restart` after changing settings for PM2. The live client no longer accepts CLI options.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LENIA_URL` | `ws://192.168.0.15:9876/ws` | WebSocket server. |
| `LENIA_CONFIG` | Unset | Optional JSON simulation start file; otherwise fetch the server preset. |
| `LENIA_WINDOWED` | `false` | Set `true` for an 800×800 window. |
| `LENIA_MOTION_DEVICE` | `/dev/i2c-1` | Motion sensor I²C device. |
| `LENIA_MOTION_THRESHOLD` | `0.12` | Positive X/Y acceleration-change threshold in g. |
| `LENIA_MOTION_SCREEN_X` | `y` | Sensor axis mapped to screen X: `x`, `-x`, `y`, or `-y`. |
| `LENIA_MOTION_SCREEN_Y` | `x` | Sensor axis mapped to screen Y; must differ from screen X's sensor axis. |
| `LENIA_PERSON_PROXIMITY` | `0.5` | Person box height fraction; greater than 0 and less than 1. |

For example, set `LENIA_PERSON_PROXIMITY=0.35` to react farther away. These settings configure the client locally; the optional JSON file configures the server simulation.

The client preserves the preset FPS, population, simulation resolution, and timestep. It adds `output_size` matching the shorter display dimension, requesting 800×800 JPEGs on the Raspberry Pi while retaining the 1024×1024 simulation. It adds no client FPS cap.

The client keeps two frame requests in flight and replaces each request as its frame arrives. This allows the server to prepare the following frame during delivery and avoids waiting for a new round trip between simulation steps. The request count stays bounded; every received frame is displayed.
