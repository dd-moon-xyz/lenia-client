# Display

The Raspberry Pi uses an 800×800 HDMI display and a Wayland desktop. The client uses uv-managed Python 3.14. The desktop must run as `bastian` for the fullscreen client. Enable desktop autologin with `sudo raspi-config` if the display should work after reboot without manual login.

Use the standard `vc4-kms-v3d` driver in `/boot/firmware/config.txt` with no DPI display overlay. HDMI should be the only enabled desktop output so fullscreen playback consistently opens there after reboot. The connected display is currently `HDMI-A-2` at 800×800.
